# SwarmGPXConverter


I developed this tool to export my Swarm Checkins into the app [Fog of the world](https://www.fogofworld.com/en/).
It will download all your checkins and convert them to a GPX file which can be imported into the app. 

## Prerequisites

1. Account and a registered app at https://developer.foursquare.com (free)
2. A Swarm Account (duh!)

## Usage

1. Once cloned, switch into the directory of the app.
2. Execute: ```node app.js```. This will give you an overview about how to use the app. 

## Disclaimer

This is my first node app so use at your own risk :)
